# TriangleSolver
A Visual Basic project  I created when I was first time learning coding in high school back to (2008?). 

Really enjoy that beautiful memory. Comments was written in Chinese because at that time I was at grade 10 in Shanghai.

Usage: it's been around 8 years. When I was still using VB6 as programming language. Maybe the windows xp legacy exe file still works?
